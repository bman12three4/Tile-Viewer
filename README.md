# Tile Viewer

This code contains the tile engine for use in my Apple IIc games.
The whole program simply runs through a loop and draws each different
tile to the screen. The purpose of this is to test out new designs, but
it also shows how to use the tile engine. All you need is the position
of the tile and the number of the tile to draw it to the screen.

To create the tiles, you could either do it by hand or use the Tile Maker
program. That program works okay, but it doesn't show exactly what will
happen on the real hardware so sometimes you have to try something out and
see what happens.
